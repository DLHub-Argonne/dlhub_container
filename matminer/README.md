# Matminer Example

Uses [matminer](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matminer/) to build a random forest model that predicts the formation enthalpy of a material from its compostiion.
The training data comes from a paper by [Faber et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/qua.24917) and is based on an approach by [Ward et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/npjcompumats201628)
