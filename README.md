# DLHub Container Repository

This repository contains many examples for how to make a servable for DLHub. 

Each directory contains the files necessary to create a different servable, and a script for documenting and submitting it to DLHub using the [`dlhub_toolbox`](https://github.com/dlhub-argonne/dlhub_toolbox) and [`dlhub_client`](https://github.com/dlhub-argonne/dlhub_client)
