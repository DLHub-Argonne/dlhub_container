# Deep-Learning Super-resolution Image Reconstruction

Convolutional autoencoder [useful for super-resolution microscopy](https://github.com/leaxp/Deep-Learning-Super-Resolution-Image-Reconstruction-DSIR).
It can be run against a directory of images, such as the ones available here: https://github.com/leaxp/Deep-Learning-Super-Resolution-Image-Reconstruction-DSIR
