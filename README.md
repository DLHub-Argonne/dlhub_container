# DLHub Container Repository

This repository contains many examples for how to make a servable for [the Data and Learning Hub for Science (DLHub)](https://www.dlhub.org). 

Each directory contains the files necessary to create a different servable, and a script for documenting and submitting it to DLHub using the [`dlhub_toolbox`](https://github.com/dlhub-argonne/dlhub_toolbox) and [`dlhub_client`](https://github.com/dlhub-argonne/dlhub_client)

## Detailed Contents of Each Servable Directory

Each directory, which corresponds to a single model, most contain the following:

- `README.md`: A file that describes the servable
- `describe_model.py`: A Python script that creates metadata describing the servable and saves it to disk
- `model_metadata.json`: The JSON description of the model generated by `describe_model.py`. We store it in the GitHub to provide examples of these files, and to easily determine how output changes with updates to DLHub tools.

Eventually, we will write a tool that scans for all correctly-formatted directories and publishes them to DLHub.
